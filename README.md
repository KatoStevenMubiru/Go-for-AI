# Go Learning Journey for AI

This repository documents my journey in learning Go (Golang), with a focus on applying it to AI/ML, infrastructure development, and building robust AI systems.

## Long-Term Goals

- Master Go programming language
- Apply Go to projects in:
  - AI/ML Systems
  - Machine Learning Infrastructure
  - Distributed Systems
  - High-Performance Computing
  - MLOps and Model Serving

## Learning Roadmap

This repository follows a structured learning roadmap, divided into phases:

### Phase 1: Foundations & Core Go (Weeks 1-8)
- Basic Go syntax and concepts
- Go tooling and ecosystem
- Testing and benchmarking
- Standard library mastery

### Phase 2: Advanced Go & AI Foundations (Weeks 9-16)
- Concurrency patterns
- Microservices architecture
- Basic ML concepts in Go
- Integration with AI services

### Phase 3: AI/ML Implementation (Weeks 17-24)
- Building ML pipelines
- Model serving systems
- Distributed training support
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Production AI Systems (Weeks 25+)
- Scalable AI infrastructure
- MLOps practices
- Production-grade systems
- Advanced optimizations
